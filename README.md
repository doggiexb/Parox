# Parox
frame-processing autoplayer in c++

# Features
Works on every ns ❌ (Accuracy will vary dependent on the ns)

Works on low ns ❌ (Note stacks are practically invisible)

Configuration editor for changing keyMappings ❌

Enable / Disable ✅

Works on high ns ✅ (Usually around 3x-3.8x < 60ms hit time more than 50% of the time)

Going to hopefully fix this project or use a different method for the autoplayer after I get my new desktop as my CPU is on its last life 😭. I'm not sure if the slow speed and inconsistencies stem from my low-end specs but I assume that is the case. I've list my setup for your comparison.

I've been working on the configuration editor for changing keybinds but I've not decided a key or layout on how it should be opened.
